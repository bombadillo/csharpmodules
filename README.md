# csharpmodules
A collection of c# interfaces/classes that are useful enough to collate.

# Structure

Each area of development should have it's own folder e.g. a module that interacts with the filesystem should be filed under the folder `filesystem`. 

# Contributing

If your module doesn't fit within any of the existing folder areas, create a new one within your pull request.
